You've reached the point where you need real financial leadership. Decisions are getting bigger, stakes are getting higher, and you're tired of flying blind. You need a CFO.

But here's the question that stops most founders: **Do you need a full-time CFO, or will a fractional CFO do the job?**

This isn't just a question of budget (though budget matters). It's a question of fit, timing, and what your business actually needs right now. Let's break down the real costs and benefits of each option so you can make an informed decision.

## What Is a Fractional CFO?

A fractional CFO is a senior finance executive who works with your company on a part-time or contracted basis. Instead of paying for 40+ hours a week, you get CFO-level expertise for the hours you actually need — typically 10-30 hours per month.

Fractional CFOs aren't junior consultants playing dress-up. They're experienced professionals — often former full-time CFOs — who've chosen to work with multiple companies instead of one. You get the expertise without the full-time commitment.

## What Is a Full-Time CFO?

A full-time CFO is a dedicated executive who joins your leadership team as a W-2 employee. They're fully embedded in your company, attending every meeting, managing your finance function, and available whenever you need them.

For large companies with complex operations, a full-time CFO is essential. The question is whether *your* company has reached that point.

## The Cost Comparison: Real Numbers

Let's start with what everyone wants to know: the money.

### Full-Time CFO Costs

| Cost Component | Annual Amount |
|---------------|---------------|
| Base Salary | $200,000 - $350,000 |
| Bonus (15-25% of salary) | $30,000 - $87,500 |
| Equity/Stock Options | Variable (1-3% for growth-stage) |
| Benefits (health, 401k, etc.) | $25,000 - $50,000 |
| Payroll Taxes | $15,000 - $27,000 |
| **Total Annual Cost** | **$270,000 - $514,500+** |

And that's before you factor in:
- Recruiting costs ($50,000-$100,000 for executive search)
- Onboarding time (3-6 months to full effectiveness)
- Opportunity cost if the hire doesn't work out

### Fractional CFO Costs

| Engagement Level | Monthly Cost | Annual Cost |
|-----------------|--------------|-------------|
| Light (5-10 hrs/month) | $1,500 - $3,000 | $18,000 - $36,000 |
| Standard (15-20 hrs/month) | $4,000 - $7,000 | $48,000 - $84,000 |
| Heavy (25-40 hrs/month) | $8,000 - $15,000 | $96,000 - $180,000 |

**The math is stark:** A fractional CFO typically costs 20-40% of a full-time hire while delivering 80%+ of the strategic value.

## When a Fractional CFO Makes Sense

A fractional CFO is the right choice when:

### 1. You're Between $1M and $30M in Revenue
Most companies in this range need CFO-level thinking but can't justify a full-time CFO salary. A fractional CFO gives you the strategy without the overhead. (For a deeper dive into what fractional CFOs actually do, see our [Complete Guide to Fractional CFO Services](/guides/fractional-cfo-services/).)

### 2. You Have Specific, Defined Needs
Raising capital? Going through M&A? Implementing new financial systems? A fractional CFO can tackle these projects intensively, then scale back.

### 3. Your Finance Function Is Otherwise Handled
If you have a competent controller or bookkeeper handling day-to-day operations, you may only need strategic oversight — not full-time execution. (Not sure if you've outgrown DIY bookkeeping? Here are [10 signs it's time to get help](/blog/10-signs-outgrown-diy-bookkeeping/).)

### 4. You Value Flexibility
Business needs change. With a fractional CFO, you can scale hours up during busy periods (fundraising, year-end) and down during quieter times.

### 5. You Want Diverse Experience
Fractional CFOs typically work with multiple companies across industries. They've seen patterns you haven't and can bring outside perspectives.

---

## When a Full-Time CFO Makes Sense

A full-time CFO becomes necessary when:

### 1. You're Past $50M in Revenue (Usually)
At this scale, financial complexity demands constant attention. M&A activity, multiple business units, international operations, and complex capital structures require someone fully dedicated.

### 2. You're Going Public (IPO)
Public company financial requirements — SEC reporting, SOX compliance, investor relations — require a full-time executive. No fractional solution can handle this.

### 3. You Have a Complex Finance Team to Manage
If you have controllers, FP&A analysts, treasury staff, and tax specialists, someone needs to lead and develop that team full-time.

### 4. You Need Constant Board and Investor Interaction
If you're presenting to your board monthly, meeting with investors weekly, and constantly fielding financial questions, you need someone always available.

### 5. Strategic Finance Is Central to Your Business Model
Some businesses (finance, insurance, asset-intensive industries) have finance so core to their model that a full-time CFO is non-negotiable from earlier stages.

## The Hybrid Model: Getting the Best of Both

Many growing companies use a hybrid approach:

1. **Start with a fractional CFO** to build financial infrastructure and strategy
2. **Add a strong controller** to handle day-to-day operations
3. **Increase fractional hours** as complexity grows
4. **Transition to full-time** when the math finally makes sense (usually $30M+ revenue)

This graduated approach lets you build capability without overcommitting too early. For a complete breakdown of how fractional engagements work across different business stages, read our [Complete Guide to Fractional CFO Services](/guides/fractional-cfo-services/).

## Questions to Ask Yourself

Before making a decision, answer honestly:

1. **How many hours of CFO-level work do you actually need per week?**
   If it's under 15 hours, fractional is almost certainly the answer.

2. **What's your runway?**
   A full-time CFO is a 2-3 year commitment minimum. Make sure you can sustain it.

3. **What specific outcomes do you need?**
   If you need a fundraise closed or systems implemented, project-based fractional work may be ideal.

4. **How complex is your finance function?**
   Simple = fractional works great. Complex = maybe need full-time.

5. **What's your growth trajectory?**
   Hypergrowth companies may need to hire full-time earlier. Steady growers can stay fractional longer.

## The ROI Question

Both fractional and full-time CFOs should deliver measurable ROI. Expect:

- **Better capital efficiency** (reducing cash burn, optimizing working capital)
- **Improved fundraising outcomes** (higher valuations, faster closes)
- **Reduced financial risk** (better controls, compliance, forecasting)
- **Time savings for founders** (offloading financial decisions to an expert)

A good fractional CFO often pays for themselves within 3-6 months through identified savings, improved pricing, or better capital allocation.

## Making the Decision

Here's the simple framework:

| Your Situation | Recommendation |
|---------------|----------------|
| < $3M revenue, need strategic guidance | Fractional (light engagement) |
| $3M-$15M revenue, growing steadily | Fractional (standard engagement) |
| $15M-$30M revenue, complex operations | Fractional (heavy) or evaluate full-time |
| > $30M revenue, multiple entities/locations | Likely full-time |
| Preparing for IPO or acquisition | Full-time (or very heavy fractional) |
