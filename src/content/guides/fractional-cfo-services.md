faq:
  - question: "How is a fractional CFO different from a consultant?"
    answer: "A consultant typically comes in for a defined project with a clear end date. A fractional CFO is an ongoing member of your team — they develop deep knowledge of your business and serve as your strategic finance partner over months or years. The relationship is continuous, not project-based."
  - question: "Can a fractional CFO replace my bookkeeper?"
    answer: "No — different roles. A fractional CFO provides strategic financial leadership. Bookkeeping is the operational work of recording transactions and maintaining clean books. You need both, and they work together. Some fractional CFO firms offer both services, giving you an integrated solution."
  - question: "How many hours per month does a fractional CFO typically work?"
    answer: "Typical engagements range from 10-40 hours per month, depending on complexity and scope. Most growing businesses benefit from 15-25 hours monthly — enough for meaningful strategic work without paying for unused time."
  - question: "How long are fractional CFO engagements?"
    answer: "Engagements typically run month-to-month or in 6-12 month terms. The relationship often continues for years as long as both parties see value. Some clients eventually hire a full-time CFO; others stay with fractional support indefinitely."
  - question: "Do fractional CFOs work remotely?"
    answer: "Most do, yes. The fractional CFO model is well-suited to remote work — modern tools allow full financial collaboration without physical presence. Some engagements include periodic on-site visits for team meetings, board presentations, or intensive planning sessions."
  - question: "What size company should hire a fractional CFO?"
    answer: "Fractional CFOs serve companies ranging from $500K to $50M+ in revenue, though the sweet spot is typically $1M–$20M. Below $500K, financial complexity rarely justifies the investment. Above $20M, companies often have (or need) dedicated full-time finance leadership."
  - question: "Will a fractional CFO work with my existing accountant or bookkeeper?"
    answer: "Absolutely. A good fractional CFO coordinates with your existing team and improves how everyone works together. They can help upgrade your bookkeeping, manage your accountant relationship, and ensure information flows smoothly."
  - question: "What results can I expect from hiring a fractional CFO?"
    answer: "Common outcomes include faster, more reliable financial reporting, clear financial forecasts and budgets, improved cash flow management, better data for decision-making, successful fundraising or financing, more time freed from financial tasks, and confidence in your numbers."

Your business is growing. Revenue is up, your team is expanding, and the financial decisions keep getting more complex. You know you need serious financial leadership — someone who can see around corners, manage cash flow strategically, and help you make confident decisions.

But here's the problem: a full-time CFO costs $200,000 or more per year. For most small and mid-sized businesses, that's simply not realistic.

Enter the **fractional CFO** — a solution that's transforming how growing businesses access executive-level financial expertise.

This guide covers everything you need to know about fractional CFO services: what they are, how they work, what they cost, and how to decide if they're right for your business. Whether you're a founder doing $500K in revenue or an operator scaling past $5M, this guide will help you make an informed decision.

## What Is a Fractional CFO?

A **fractional CFO** (also called a part-time CFO, outsourced CFO, or virtual CFO) is an experienced financial executive who works with your company on a part-time or contract basis. Instead of dedicating 40+ hours per week to one company, a fractional CFO divides their time across multiple clients — giving each business access to senior financial leadership at a fraction of the cost.

Think of it this way: you're not hiring *a fraction* of a CFO's expertise. You're getting the *full* expertise of an experienced CFO, applied to your business for a fraction of the time (and cost).

### What Makes Someone a "CFO"?

A CFO — Chief Financial Officer — is fundamentally different from a bookkeeper, accountant, or controller. Here's the distinction:

| Role | Primary Focus | Orientation |
|------|---------------|-------------|
| **Bookkeeper** | Recording transactions, maintaining clean books | Historical (what happened) |
| **Accountant/CPA** | Tax compliance, financial statements, audits | Historical + Compliance |
| **Controller** | Financial reporting, internal controls, accounting team management | Historical + Operational |
| **CFO** | Strategic financial planning, fundraising, forecasting, business decisions | Future-focused + Strategic |

A CFO answers questions like:
- "Should we hire two more salespeople, or invest in marketing?"
- "What happens to our runway if revenue drops 20%?"
- "How do we structure this deal to maximize value?"
- "Are we priced correctly? What would changing our model do to margins?"

In short: **bookkeepers record what happened, CFOs shape what happens next.**

### Why "Fractional" Works

The fractional model works because most growing businesses don't need a CFO 40 hours per week. They need CFO-level thinking applied to their biggest decisions — often just 5-20 hours per month.

A fractional CFO might:
- Build your first real financial forecast
- Attend monthly leadership meetings
- Prepare your financials for a bank loan or investor pitch
- Design KPI dashboards so you can manage by the numbers
- Guide you through a major decision (pricing change, expansion, acquisition)

The rest of the month, you don't need them hovering. You need them available, strategic, and engaged — not filling time.

## Full-Time CFO vs. Fractional CFO: A Complete Comparison

One of the most common questions we hear: *"At what point should I just hire a full-time CFO instead?"*

Here's a detailed comparison to help you decide:

### Cost Comparison

| Factor | Full-Time CFO | Fractional CFO |
|--------|---------------|----------------|
| **Base salary** | $175,000–$350,000/year | N/A |
| **Benefits & taxes** | Add 25-40% ($45K–$100K) | N/A |
| **Equity/bonus** | Often 10-20% of salary | Rarely |
| **Monthly engagement** | Fixed cost regardless of need | $3,000–$12,000/month typical |
| **Annual total cost** | $220,000–$500,000+ | $36,000–$150,000 |
| **Cost per hour of strategic work** | Often lower value-per-hour (filling time) | High value-per-hour (focused engagement) |

### Availability & Commitment

| Factor | Full-Time CFO | Fractional CFO |
|--------|---------------|----------------|
| **Hours per week** | 40-50+ dedicated | 5-20 as needed |
| **On-site presence** | Full-time (hybrid common) | Remote-first, occasional on-site |
| **Response time** | Immediate during work hours | Usually same-day, sometimes next-day |
| **Length of commitment** | Employment relationship (harder to unwind) | Contract-based (flexible) |
| **Ramp-up time** | 3-6 months to full effectiveness | 2-4 weeks typical |

### Strategic Value

| Factor | Full-Time CFO | Fractional CFO |
|--------|---------------|----------------|
| **Depth of company knowledge** | Deep (lives and breathes your business) | Strong (focused engagement, learns fast) |
| **Breadth of experience** | One company at a time | Multiple companies, industries, situations |
| **Network & resources** | Personal network | Often broader (sees what works across clients) |
| **Executive team integration** | Full member of leadership team | Advisor/partner to leadership team |
| **Board/investor relations** | Primary relationship | Can lead or support |

### When Each Makes Sense

**A fractional CFO is ideal when:**
- Revenue is $500K–$20M (varies by complexity)
- You need strategic guidance but not daily oversight
- Cash flow doesn't support a $250K+ hire
- You're in a transition (fundraising, sale, rapid growth)
- You want to test-drive CFO support before committing to a full-time hire

**A full-time CFO makes sense when:**
- Revenue exceeds $20M+ with complex operations
- You have a finance team that needs daily leadership
- Investor/board expectations require dedicated executive presence
- The business complexity justifies the cost (M&A-active, multiple entities, etc.)

## Signs Your Business Needs a Fractional CFO

Not sure if you're ready for fractional CFO services? Here are the most common signals:

### 1. You're Making Big Decisions Without Real Data

You're deciding whether to hire, expand, or invest — but you're going on gut feel, not financial models. You don't have a reliable forecast, and you can't quickly answer questions like:
- What's our gross margin by product/service line?
- How much runway do we have at current burn?
- What would adding a salesperson do to our break-even?

**If you're guessing on six-figure decisions, you need better financial intelligence.**

### 2. Cash Flow Feels Like a Mystery

Revenue is growing, but somehow cash is always tight. You don't know where the money goes. You can't predict when you'll hit a crunch. The gap between "profitable on paper" and "cash in the bank" confuses you.

**A fractional CFO builds cash flow visibility and helps you manage proactively, not reactively.**

### 3. You're Fundraising or Seeking Capital

Banks and investors ask for financial projections, and you're scrambling. You don't have a model. Your historical financials aren't clean. You're not sure how to present your numbers confidently.

**Fractional CFOs prepare businesses for funding — they speak investor/banker language fluently.**

### 4. You've Outgrown Your Bookkeeper (But Can't Afford a CFO)

Your bookkeeper keeps the lights on, but they're not strategic. You need someone who can interpret the numbers, not just record them. Yet a full-time CFO is out of budget.

**This is the exact gap fractional CFO services fill.**

### 5. Financial Reporting Is Slow, Confusing, or Unreliable

Books close late. Reports don't make sense. You don't trust the numbers. You spend hours asking "is this right?" instead of "what should we do about this?"

**A fractional CFO fixes financial reporting processes and creates dashboards you can actually use.**

### 6. You're Planning a Major Transition

Preparing for acquisition. Considering a merger. Expanding to new markets. Launching a new product line. Restructuring the business.

**Major transitions require major financial planning. A fractional CFO provides the horsepower without the permanent headcount.**

### 7. You Spend Too Much Time Being the "Accidental CFO"

You're the founder, the CEO, the salesperson — and somehow also the person digging through QuickBooks. Finance has become a time sink that pulls you away from what you're best at.

**A fractional CFO takes the finance burden off your plate so you can focus on growth.**

## How to Choose the Right Fractional CFO

Not all fractional CFOs are created equal. Here's how to find the right fit:

### 1. Define What You Actually Need

Before you start interviewing, get clear on your priorities:
- Is this strategic advice or hands-on execution?
- What's the burning problem we need solved first?
- What does success look like in 6 months?

The clearer your needs, the better you can evaluate fit.

### 2. Look for Relevant Experience

The best fractional CFO for you has seen your situation before:
- **Industry experience:** Someone who knows SaaS metrics vs. manufacturing cost accounting vs. professional services billing
- **Stage experience:** Startup CFO skills differ from $10M company CFO skills
- **Situation experience:** Fundraising? Turnaround? Rapid scaling? Find someone who's done it

### 3. Evaluate Communication Style

You'll be trusting this person with sensitive information and hard decisions. Assess:
- Do they explain things clearly, or hide behind jargon?
- Do they ask good questions about your business?
- Are they responsive and reliable in the sales process? (Preview of the relationship)
- Do they challenge your assumptions productively?

### 4. Check the Operating Model

Understand how they work:
- Who actually does the work? (Some firms use senior names to sell, then hand off to juniors)
- How will you communicate? (Calls, email, Slack?)
- How quickly do they respond?
- What tools do they use?

### 5. Assess Cultural Fit

This is a close working relationship. Consider:
- Do they match your company's pace and intensity?
- Are they comfortable with your communication style?
- Do they get excited about your business, or is it just a gig?

### Questions to Ask in the Interview

1. "Walk me through your experience with businesses like ours."
2. "What's the first thing you'd do in the first 30 days?"
3. "Tell me about a time you helped a client through [relevant challenge]."
4. "How do you structure your engagements?"
5. "Who will I actually be working with day-to-day?"
6. "What types of clients are *not* a good fit for you?"
7. "Can I speak with 2-3 current or recent clients?"

### Red Flags to Watch For

- **Overpromising:** "I'll transform your business in 30 days"
- **Vague scope:** Can't clearly explain what you'll get
- **No discovery questions:** They pitch without understanding your situation
- **Bait and switch:** Senior person sells, junior person delivers
- **No specialization:** "I work with everyone" (often means expert at nothing)
- **Poor communication:** Slow responses, unclear answers during sales process

## Frequently Asked Questions About Fractional CFO Services

You need both, and they work together. Some fractional CFO firms (like Pythia Insights) offer both services, giving you an integrated solution.

Typical engagements range from 10-40 hours per month, depending on complexity and scope. Most growing businesses benefit from 15-25 hours monthly — enough for meaningful strategic work without paying for unused time.
