faq:
  - question: "When should a startup hire a bookkeeper?"
    answer: "Most startups should get professional bookkeeping help once they have regular transactions — typically after raising a pre-seed round or hitting ~$10K/month in expenses. Before that, founders can often manage with simple accounting software. The cost of fixing messy books later far exceeds the cost of keeping them clean from the start."
  - question: "How do I calculate my startup's runway?"
    answer: "Runway = Cash Balance ÷ Monthly Burn Rate. If you have $500K in the bank and burn $50K/month, you have 10 months of runway. For a more accurate picture, account for expected changes in burn rate and any anticipated revenue. Most startups should maintain at least 12-18 months of runway."
  - question: "What's a good burn rate for a startup?"
    answer: "There's no universal 'good' burn rate — it depends on your stage, market, and growth strategy. However, your burn should be intentional and tied to specific milestones. Early-stage startups often burn $20K-$100K/month; post-Series A might burn $200K-$500K+/month. The key is knowing exactly where every dollar goes and what you're getting in return."
  - question: "Do startups need a CFO?"
    answer: "Most startups don't need a full-time CFO until they're post-Series B or have significant operational complexity. Before that, a fractional CFO (10-20 hours/month) can provide strategic finance support at a fraction of the cost. Some startups bring in fractional CFO help for specific events like fundraising, even earlier."
  - question: "What financial statements should startups track?"
    answer: "At minimum: Profit & Loss (P&L), Balance Sheet, and Cash Flow Statement. Early-stage startups should also track runway projections, burn rate trends, and key operational metrics (CAC, LTV, churn). As you raise money, investors will expect GAAP-compliant financials and detailed monthly/quarterly reporting."
  - question: "How should startups track equity and cap tables?"
    answer: "Use dedicated cap table software like Carta, Pulley, or AngelList Stack. Spreadsheets work for simple cap tables but become error-prone as you add employees, options, SAFEs, and convertible notes. Clean cap table management is critical — mistakes can delay or kill fundraising rounds."
  - question: "When should startups switch from cash to accrual accounting?"
    answer: "Most startups should use accrual accounting from the start if they have any complexity (SaaS subscriptions, prepaid expenses, deferred revenue). Investors and acquirers expect GAAP-compliant accrual financials. Cash accounting might be fine for very early pre-revenue startups, but switching later is painful."
  - question: "What's the biggest financial mistake startups make?"
    answer: "Running out of money without knowing it's coming. Many startups fail not because the business idea was bad, but because founders didn't track cash closely enough and ran out of runway before they could course-correct. The second biggest mistake: messy books that create problems during fundraising or due diligence."

You've got an idea, maybe some traction, and hopefully some capital. Now comes the part nobody teaches in startup school: **actually managing the money.**

Here's the uncomfortable truth most founders discover too late: financial management isn't just back-office admin work. It's how you know whether you're winning or losing. It's how you avoid running out of cash. It's how you make the decisions that determine whether your startup survives.

This guide is for founders who want to get this right — not MBA-level financial theory, but the practical financial management skills you actually need from pre-seed through Series A and beyond.

## Why Financial Management Matters for Startups

Let's start with some hard data: **29% of startups fail because they run out of cash.** That's the second most common cause of startup death, right after "no market need."

But here's what's worse: most of those founders didn't see it coming. They didn't wake up one day and decide to run out of money. They just... weren't paying close enough attention.

Good financial management prevents that. It means:

- **Knowing your runway** — exactly how long your cash will last
- **Understanding your burn** — where every dollar goes and why
- **Seeing problems early** — before they become existential
- **Making better decisions** — with actual data instead of gut feelings
- **Raising money smoothly** — because your books are clean and your story is clear

This isn't about becoming a finance person. It's about not dying.

## The Foundation: Key Metrics Every Founder Must Know

Before we get into systems and processes, let's establish the numbers you need to know cold. If an investor asks you any of these on the spot, you should be able to answer without checking a spreadsheet.

### Runway

**What it is:** How many months until you run out of money at your current burn rate.

**How to calculate it:**
```
Runway = Cash Balance ÷ Monthly Burn Rate
```

**Example:** $600,000 in the bank ÷ $50,000 monthly burn = 12 months runway

**Why it matters:** Runway is your survival clock. Everything you do should be contextualized against it. Hiring decision? Check the runway impact. New marketing spend? Check the runway impact. Runway under 6 months? You should be fundraising or cutting costs *now*.

**The nuance:** Simple runway calculations assume constant burn, but reality is messier. Build a model that accounts for planned changes (new hires, expected revenue, seasonality). And always know your "default alive" point — when revenue will exceed expenses.

### Burn Rate

**What it is:** How much cash you're spending each month (net of any revenue).

**Gross burn** = Total monthly expenses
**Net burn** = Expenses minus revenue

Most early-stage startups talk about net burn because they have limited revenue.

**What's normal:** There's no universal "right" burn rate. But here are rough benchmarks by stage:

| Stage | Typical Monthly Burn |
|-------|---------------------|
| Pre-seed | $10K - $30K |
| Seed | $30K - $100K |
| Series A | $100K - $300K |
| Series B | $300K - $750K |

**The real question:** Is your burn *intentional*? Every dollar should tie to a milestone or learning. "We burn $80K/month" is incomplete. "We burn $80K/month, which gives us 18 months to hit $50K MRR and prove product-market fit" — that's a plan.

### Cash Balance (Not Revenue, Not Profit)

**What it is:** How much actual cash is in your bank account right now.

This seems obvious, but many founders confuse revenue with cash. You might have $100K in bookings, but if customers pay in 60 days, that's not cash yet. Cash is what pays salaries.

**Track it obsessively.** Check your bank balance weekly at minimum. Know where every dollar came from and where it's going.

### Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) / Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR)

**What it is:** Predictable revenue from subscriptions or contracts, measured monthly (MRR) or annualized (ARR).

**How to calculate:**
```
MRR = Sum of all recurring subscription revenue this month
ARR = MRR × 12
```

**Why it matters:** For SaaS and subscription businesses, MRR/ARR is the core growth metric. Investors will care about MRR growth rate, net revenue retention, and MRR breakdown (new, expansion, churned).

### Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)

**What it is:** How much you spend to acquire one new customer.

**How to calculate:**
```
CAC = (Sales + Marketing Spend) ÷ New Customers Acquired
```

**Example:** You spent $10,000 on marketing and sales last month and acquired 20 customers. CAC = $500.

**The key question:** Is your CAC sustainable? Compare it to customer lifetime value (LTV). If CAC exceeds LTV, you're paying to lose money on each customer.

### Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)

**What it is:** The total revenue you expect from a customer over their entire relationship with you.

**Simple calculation:**
```
LTV = Average Revenue Per Customer × Average Customer Lifespan
```

**Better calculation (for SaaS):**
```
LTV = ARPA ÷ Monthly Churn Rate
```
Where ARPA = Average Revenue Per Account

**The magic ratio:** LTV:CAC of 3:1 or higher is the standard benchmark. Below that, you're spending too much to acquire customers who don't generate enough value.

## Building Your Financial Foundation

Metrics are important, but they don't appear magically. You need systems to generate accurate numbers. Here's how to build a solid financial foundation — the right way, from the start.

### Level 1: Basic Financial Hygiene (Pre-Revenue)

**When:** Day 1. Before you spend a dollar.

**What you need:**

1. **Separate bank account.** Never mix personal and business finances. Ever. Open a business checking account before you spend anything.

2. **Simple accounting software.** QuickBooks Online or Xero are the standards. Wave is free but limited. Pick one and use it from day one.

3. **Receipt tracking.** Every expense needs documentation. Use Expensify, Brex, or just a dedicated email folder. The IRS doesn't care about your MVP timeline.

4. **Basic expense categorization.** Set up categories: Payroll, Software, Marketing, Legal, etc. Consistent categorization makes everything easier later.

**Time investment:** 2-3 hours to set up, 30 minutes weekly to maintain.

### Level 2: Structured Bookkeeping (Post-First-Funding)

**When:** After you raise money (even friends & family) or hit ~$10K/month in expenses.

**What you need:**

1. **Professional bookkeeper.** This is when DIY becomes penny-wise, pound-foolish. A good bookkeeper costs $300-$1,000/month and prevents expensive messes.

2. **Monthly close process.** Books should be "closed" (reconciled, reviewed, finalized) within 2-3 weeks of month-end. Not "roughly right" — actually closed.

3. **Accrual accounting.** If you have any complexity (subscriptions, prepaid expenses, inventory), switch to accrual now. It's how GAAP works and what investors expect.

4. **Chart of accounts cleanup.** Your bookkeeper should organize your accounts to match your business structure. Ask for it to align with common startup reporting formats.

**Pro tip:** Use a bookkeeping service that specializes in startups. They'll understand your context better than a generalist accountant.

### Level 3: Financial Operations (Post-Seed or $1M+ Raise)

**When:** After raising a proper seed round or when you have 5+ employees.

**What you need:**

1. **Monthly financial review.** Sit down with your bookkeeper (or finance person) monthly to review actuals vs. plan. Not a glance at the P&L — an actual conversation.

2. **Budget and forecast.** Build a 12-18 month financial model. Update it quarterly at minimum. This becomes your operating plan.

3. **Cash flow management.** Go beyond runway calculation to active cash management. Know your payment cycles, manage receivables, optimize payables timing.

4. **Basic FP&A.** Even if you can't afford a full-time finance hire, someone (maybe a fractional CFO) should be doing variance analysis and helping you understand what the numbers mean.

5. **Cap table software.** If you haven't already, move your cap table to proper software (Carta, Pulley, AngelList Stack). You'll thank yourself at your next raise.

**Time investment:** 4-8 hours monthly of founder attention, plus dedicated finance support.

### Level 3: Strategic Finance (Series A+)

**When:** After Series A, or when financial complexity demands it.

**What you need:**

1. **Fractional or full-time CFO.** Someone who can think strategically about capital allocation, fundraising, and financial story — not just keep the books.

2. **Board reporting.** Standardized monthly or quarterly reports for your board. This forces discipline and creates accountability.

3. **Scenario planning.** What if growth slows? What if a competitor raises? What if you can't raise your next round? Model the scenarios.

4. **Investor relations.** Managing existing investor updates and preparing for future rounds becomes a real job.

5. **Financial controls.** Segregation of duties, approval workflows, audit preparation. The boring stuff that protects you.

## Cash Management: The Art of Not Running Out

The startup graveyard is full of companies with great products that ran out of money. Cash management is the discipline of making sure that doesn't happen to you.

### The Cash Conversion Cycle

Understand how money flows through your business:

1. **You spend money** (hiring, marketing, inventory)
2. **You acquire customers** (hopefully)
3. **Customers pay you** (sometimes immediately, sometimes later)
4. **The cycle repeats**

The gap between when you spend and when you collect is your cash conversion cycle. The shorter it is, the less cash you need.

**Ways to improve it:**
- Collect payments upfront (annual subscriptions > monthly)
- Invoice faster and follow up aggressively on receivables
- Negotiate longer payment terms with vendors
- Hold inventory loosely (if applicable)

### Managing Payables Strategically

**Don't pay early for no reason.** If a vendor gives you 30 days to pay, use 30 days. That's free financing.

**But don't burn bridges.** Some vendors (especially small ones) depend on timely payment. Balance cash optimization with relationship maintenance.

**Negotiate terms.** Many vendors will offer extended terms (net 45, net 60) if you ask, especially for larger contracts.

### The Cash Buffer Philosophy

How much cash should you keep as a buffer? It depends on your risk tolerance and business model, but here are some frameworks:

**Conservative:** 18+ months runway at all times
**Moderate:** 12-18 months runway
**Aggressive:** 6-12 months runway

**The right answer depends on:**
- How predictable is your revenue?
- How easy is it to cut costs quickly?
- What's the fundraising environment?
- How fast does your market move?

Most experienced founders recommend maintaining at least 12 months runway, especially in uncertain markets. Running lean is admirable; running out of money is fatal.

### The "Default Alive" Calculation

Paul Graham popularized this concept: **Are you default alive or default dead?**

**Default alive:** At your current growth rate and burn rate, you'll reach profitability before running out of cash.

**Default dead:** At current trajectory, you'll run out of money before reaching profitability.

To calculate: Project your revenue growth and expense growth. When (if ever) do the lines cross? Is that before or after you run out of cash?

If you're default dead, you either need to:
1. Raise more money
2. Cut expenses
3. Accelerate growth

Knowing which one — and acting on it — is the job.

## Fundraising Finance: Numbers Investors Want to See

At some point, you'll probably raise money. When you do, investors will scrutinize your finances. Here's how to be ready.

### What Investors Look For

**At Pre-Seed/Seed:**
- Clean, accurate books (yes, even this early)
- Clear understanding of unit economics, even if theoretical
- Reasonable financial projections tied to assumptions you can defend
- Runway and burn awareness

**At Series A:**
- GAAP-compliant financial statements
- Demonstrated understanding of CAC, LTV, payback period
- Historical performance vs. plan (and good explanations for variances)
- 18-24 month detailed financial model
- Clean cap table

**At Series B+:**
- Audited or audit-ready financials
- Sophisticated cohort analysis and revenue quality metrics
- Board-level financial reporting track record
- Evidence of financial discipline and planning capability

### The Financial Model That Raises Money

Your financial model for fundraising needs to:

1. **Tell a coherent story.** The numbers should match your narrative about market, product, and growth.

2. **Be bottom-up, not top-down.** "We'll capture 1% of a $10B market" is lazy. Build from unit economics: customers × ARPU × retention.

3. **Show your assumptions clearly.** Investors will change your assumptions and see what happens. Make it easy for them.

4. **Pass the sniff test.** If you show 10x growth while cutting burn in half, be ready to explain how.

5. **Include multiple scenarios.** Base case, upside case, downside case. Shows you're thinking about risk.

### The Due Diligence Checklist

When investors get serious, they'll request documentation. Have these ready:

- [ ] Monthly P&L (12-24 months of history)
- [ ] Balance sheet
- [ ] Cash flow statement
- [ ] Bank statements (last 12 months)
- [ ] Cap table (fully diluted, including all SAFEs and options)
- [ ] Revenue breakdown by customer/cohort
- [ ] Contracts (major customers, employees, vendors)
- [ ] Tax returns (if applicable)

**The companies that close fastest have this ready *before* they start fundraising.**

## Common Financial Mistakes (and How to Avoid Them)

### Mistake 1: Ignoring Finance Until It's a Problem

**The pattern:** "We're focused on product. We'll figure out the finance stuff later."

**Why it hurts:** "Later" usually means during fundraising or when you're almost out of money — the worst possible times to realize your books are a mess.

**The fix:** Invest in basic financial infrastructure from day one. It's like brushing your teeth — boring, but prevents painful problems.

### Mistake 2: Confusing Revenue with Cash

**The pattern:** "We did $100K in sales this month!" (Meanwhile, actual cash collected: $40K, and you owe $80K in expenses.)

**Why it hurts:** You can be "profitable" on paper while running out of money. Accrual accounting is important, but cash is king.

**The fix:** Track both. Know your revenue AND your cash. Understand the gap between them.

### Mistake 3: No Financial Model

**The pattern:** "We're too early for projections. Everything changes so fast."

**Why it hurts:** Without a model, you can't answer basic questions: How long will our money last? Can we afford this hire? What does break-even look like?

**The fix:** Build a simple model. It'll be wrong, but it gives you something to update and learn from. Wrong and explicit beats right and vague.

### Mistake 4: Mixing Personal and Business Finances

**The pattern:** "I just put everything on my personal card and figure it out later."

**Why it hurts:** Tax nightmares, legal liability exposure, impossible to track real business performance, fundraising due diligence disaster.

**The fix:** Separate bank account, separate card, from day one. No exceptions.

### Mistake 5: Over-Optimizing Before Product-Market Fit

**The pattern:** "We built an amazing financial dashboard with 47 metrics!"

**Why it hurts:** You're optimizing things that don't matter yet. Before PMF, the metrics that matter are simple: cash, burn, and signals of customer traction.

**The fix:** Match financial sophistication to stage. Pre-PMF: cash, burn, basic customer metrics. Post-PMF: add unit economics, cohorts, and forecasting.

### Mistake 6: Waiting Too Long to Hire Finance Help

**The pattern:** "I can handle it myself until we're bigger."

**Why it hurts:** By the time you're bigger, you have 18 months of messy books to clean up, just when you need to fundraise.

**The fix:** Get bookkeeping help after your first meaningful funding. Get strategic finance help (fractional CFO) before you think you need it.

## The Finance Stack for Startups

### Banking

**Standard options:**
- **Mercury** — Startup-focused, clean interface, strong integrations
- **Brex** — Cash account + corporate card, good for funded startups  
- **Relay** — Simple, fee-free, good for bootstrapped companies
- **Silicon Valley Bank** — The traditional startup bank (consider diversification after 2023)

**What to look for:** FDIC insurance, easy integration with accounting software, responsive support, startup-friendly features (batch payments, international).

### Accounting Software

**For most startups:**
- **QuickBooks Online** — Industry standard, massive integration ecosystem
- **Xero** — Strong alternative, particularly popular internationally
- **Pilot** or **Bench** — If you want bookkeeping bundled in

### Cap Table

**Non-negotiable after you have investors or employees with equity:**
- **Carta** — Market leader, expensive but comprehensive
- **Pulley** — Simpler, cheaper alternative
- **AngelList Stack** — Good if you're in the AngelList ecosystem

### Expense Management

**For team expenses:**
- **Brex** — Cards + expense management integrated
- **Ramp** — Strong expense tracking, good savings features
- **Expensify** — Standalone expense reporting

### Financial Planning

**When you need forecasting:**
- **Jirav** — Startup-friendly FP&A tool
- **Mosaic** — Modern strategic finance platform
- **Google Sheets/Excel** — Still works, just requires more manual effort

## When to Bring in Help

### Bookkeeper ($300-$1,000/month)

**When:** After first funding round, or when you have 20+ transactions/month

**What they do:** Categorize transactions, reconcile accounts, prepare monthly statements, manage payables/receivables

**What they don't do:** Strategic advice, financial planning, investor relations

### Fractional CFO ($2,000-$10,000/month)

**When:** Pre-fundraising, post-seed, or when financial decisions are getting complex

**What they do:** Financial strategy, modeling, fundraising support, board decks, cash management, hiring finance staff

**What they don't do:** Day-to-day bookkeeping, transaction processing

**This is where [Pythia helps](/guides/fractional-cfo-services/).** Fractional CFO support gives you strategic finance capability without the $200K+ cost of a full-time hire.

### Full-Time Finance Hire

**When:** Post-Series A, high transaction volume, or when you need dedicated daily attention

**Roles to consider:**
- **Finance Manager/Controller:** Owns the books, monthly close, basic reporting
- **VP Finance:** Adds strategic planning, team management, investor relations
- **CFO:** Full strategic finance leadership, board-level participation

Most startups don't need a full-time CFO until Series B or later. Don't over-hire.

## The Bottom Line

Startup financial management isn't about being a finance expert. It's about:

1. **Knowing your numbers** — Cash, burn, runway, and the metrics that matter for your business
2. **Building systems early** — Clean books from day one prevent expensive messes later
3. **Planning ahead** — A simple model beats no model, always
4. **Getting help when you need it** — Bookkeepers, fractional CFOs, and tools exist for a reason

The startups that survive aren't always the ones with the best product or the biggest market. Often, they're the ones that didn't run out of money at the wrong time.

Don't let financial chaos be the reason your startup fails. Build the foundation now.
